# Temporal Difference Learning and Q-Learning

It's theoretical introduction to TD-Learning and Q-Learning in jupyter notebook with practical example of tabular Q-Learning algorithm in FrozenLake environment.
I was presented at Gradient student research circle meeting.

It's based on:
* [TD Learning talk by Richard S. Sutton](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2017_sutton_td_learning/)
* [Q-Learning with Tables and Neural Networks blog post by Arthur Juliani](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0)

## Dependencies

* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
* [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

## Usage

Start `jupyter notebook` in `q_learning/doc/jupyter/` directory.
