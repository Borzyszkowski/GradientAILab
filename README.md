# AtariAI

In this project we want to explore reinforcement learning techniques in deep learning. Our baseline is experiment presented by Andrej Karpathy on his [blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). You can find his post in `<project root>/etc` directory. His work is about lightweight Policy Gradient agent.  
Starting from reproducing his work, we will further develop better agents for common reinforcement learning tasks and eventually start whole new projects based on gained experience.  
Along the road, article for Gradient research circle website should emerge.
